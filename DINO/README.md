## Replication

`checkpoint_4scale_24epochs.pth` was trained on Kaggle by running `train_4scale.ipynb`\
`checkpoint_5scale_24epochs.pth` was trained on Google Colab by running `train_5scale.ipynb`

To perform inference from checkpoints, run `inference_replication.ipynb`, which handles data and checkpoint download and inference.
